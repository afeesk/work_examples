The first part of this sample explored the well known white wine dataset using both kmeans and hierarchical 
cluster algorithms.

The core is to perform pre-processing and model various cases and then compare the result to the suggestion 
of the wine tasters to suggest a possibility of replacing the wine testers with the model.

The performances leverages accuracy of the model results in relation to the testers' results.

The second part of this sample explored a time series dataset using both neuralnet and support vector machine
algorithms.

The core is to perform pre-processing to select suitable input and output to enable the model to learn and 
then predict the next step-ahead.

The performances leverages MSE, RMSE, MAPE and a line graph to visualize the predicted and actual flow.
